// Description:

// There was a test in your class and you passed it. Congratulations!
// But you're an ambitious person. You want to know if you're better than the average student in your class.

// You receive an array with your peers' test scores. Now calculate the average and compare your score!

// Return True if you're better, else False!
// Note:

// Your points are not included in the array of your class's points. For calculating the average point you may add your point to the given array!


//my solution
function betterThanAverage(classPoints, yourPoints) {
  const average = classPoints.reduce((sum, current) => sum + current, 0)/classPoints.length
  return yourPoints > average
}


//other solution
function betterThanAverage(classPoints, yourPoints) {
  // Your code here
  var classAvg = 0;
  for (var i = 0; i < classPoints.length; i++){
    classAvg += classPoints[i]; 
  }
  classAvg = classAvg/classPoints.length; 
  return yourPoints > classAvg;
}
