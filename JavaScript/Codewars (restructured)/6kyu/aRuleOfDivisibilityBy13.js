// Description

// Example:

// What is the remainder when 1234567 is divided by 13?

// 7      6     5      4     3     2     1  (digits of 1234567 from the right)
// ×      ×     ×      ×     ×     ×     ×  (multiplication)
// 1     10     9     12     3     4     1  (the repeating sequence)

// Therefore following the method we get:

//  7×1 + 6×10 + 5×9 + 4×12 + 3×3 + 2×4 + 1×1 = 178

// We repeat the process with the number 178:

// 8x1 + 7x10 + 1x9 = 87

// and again with 87:

// 7x1 + 8x10 = 87

// From now on the sequence is stationary (we always get 87) and the remainder of 1234567 by 13 is the same as the remainder of 87 by 13 ( i.e 9).
// Task:

// Call thirt the function which processes this sequence of operations on an integer n (>=0). thirt will return the stationary number.

// thirt(1234567) calculates 178, then 87, then 87 and returns 87.

// thirt(321) calculates 48, 48 and returns 48
