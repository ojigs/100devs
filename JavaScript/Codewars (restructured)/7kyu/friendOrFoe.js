// Make a program that filters a list of strings and returns a list with only your friends name in it.

// If a name has exactly 4 letters in it, you can be sure that it has to be a friend of yours! Otherwise, you can be sure he's not...

// Ex: Input = ["Ryan", "Kieran", "Jason", "Yous"], Output = ["Ryan", "Yous"]

// i.e.

// friend ["Ryan", "Kieran", "Mark"] `shouldBe` ["Ryan", "Mark"]

// Note: keep the original order of the names in the output.


//My solution
function friend(friends){
  //your code here
  return friends.filter(item => item.length === 4)
}


//other solution
function friend(friends){
  
  //Create new array called "myFriends" for add your friends
  var i,
      len = friends.length,
      myFriends = [];
  
  
  for (i = 0; i < len; i++) {
        
       //Check for names with length equal to four and it is not a number
       if(friends[i].length == 4 && isNaN(friends[i])) {
          myFriends.push(friends[i]);
       }
      
  }
    
  return myFriends;
}
