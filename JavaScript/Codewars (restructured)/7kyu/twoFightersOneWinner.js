// Description:

// Create a function that returns the name of the winner in a fight between two fighters.

// Each fighter takes turns attacking the other and whoever kills the other first is victorious. Death is defined as having health <= 0.

// Each fighter will be a Fighter object/instance. See the Fighter class below in your chosen language.

// Both health and damagePerAttack (damage_per_attack for python) will be integers larger than 0. You can mutate the Fighter objects.
// Example:

//   declare_winner(Fighter("Lew", 10, 2), Fighter("Harry", 5, 4), "Lew") => "Lew"
  
//   Lew attacks Harry; Harry now has 3 health.
//   Harry attacks Lew; Lew now has 6 health.
//   Lew attacks Harry; Harry now has 1 health.
//   Harry attacks Lew; Lew now has 2 health.
//   Lew attacks Harry: Harry now has -1 health and is dead. Lew wins.

// function Fighter(name, health, damagePerAttack) {
//         this.name = name;
//         this.health = health;
//         this.damagePerAttack = damagePerAttack;
//         this.toString = function() { return this.name; }
// }



//My solution
function declareWinner(fighter1, fighter2, firstAttacker) {
  let currentAttacker = firstAttacker
  while (fighter1.health >= 0 && fighter2.health >=0) {
    if (currentAttacker == fighter1.name) {
      fighter2.health -= fighter1.damagePerAttack
      currentAttacker = fighter2.name
    } else {
      fighter1.health -= fighter2.damagePerAttack
      currentAttacker = fighter1.name
    }
  }
  
  return fighter1.health <= 0 ? fighter2.name : fighter1.name
}



//other solution
function declareWinner(fighter1, fighter2, firstAttacker) {
  var fac1 = Math.ceil( fighter1.health / fighter2.damagePerAttack );
  var fac2 = Math.ceil( fighter2.health / fighter1.damagePerAttack );
  if(fac1 < fac2) {
    return fighter2.name;
  } else if(fac2 < fac1) {
    return fighter1.name;
  } else {
    return firstAttacker;
  }
}
