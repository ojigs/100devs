# 100devs
Documentation of Projects done while at 100devs Agency.
100devs is a web development agency set up by Leon Noel to assist those affected by the pandemic and are out of jobs find a career in programming. It offers a training program.
I Would be documenting past projects already executed as well as adding new ones.
Also, some of the semantics used may not be foolproof as they came from the place of learning. I have identified a couple of areas to make improvements on and would be adding the workflow to the readme file of each project.
We've got some amazing stuff in here. Happy viewing!
