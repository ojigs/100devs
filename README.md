# 100devs
Documentation of Projects done while attending 100devs bootcamp
100devs is a bootcamp set up by Leon Noel to assist those affected by the pandemic and are out of jobs find a career path in programming
It is a 30 weeks long bootcamp and we are a few weeks gone at the time of creating this repository
I Would be documenting past projects already executed as well as adding new ones
Also, some of the semantics used may not be foolproof as they came from the place of learning. I have identified a couple of areas to make improvements on and would be adding the nworkflow to the readme file of each project.
We've got some amazing stuff in here. Happy viewing!
